# Etch-A-Sketch Turtle Project
Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch project built using Python's turtle graphics library! This simple drawing game lets you control a turtle on the screen and create freehand drawings using various keyboard commands. Whether you're drawing freeform shapes or experimenting with colors and speeds, this project offers a fun way to interact with Python's turtle module.
